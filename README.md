## Getting Started

### Building from source

1. Clone the repo from GitHub
```sh
git clone https://github.com/gumbarros/DevToysFlutter
```
2. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux)
3. Restore the dependencies and build the project
```dart
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
### Motivation
I really loved the idea of the original DevToys, but I was upset that it only runs on Windows. I created this project with the aim of just being a port for Linux, but since it was written in Flutter, I think it's strange to keep it only for that platform.
