## Contributing
Check [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/gumbarros/dev_widgets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Motivation
I really loved the idea of [DevToys](https://github.com/veler/DevToys), but I was upset that it only runs on Windows. I created this project with the aim of just being a port for Linux, but since it was written in Flutter, I think it's strange to keep it only for that platform.

## Why this is not DevToysLinux/Flutter anymore?
First of all, I want to stay away from any copyright issues from the original creators of DevToys as I never had any communication with them.

Second, I believe that the motivations of this project are increasingly different from the original DevToys, mainly because this application is not native exclusively to a platform.

I want along with any community member who wants to contribute, to have total creative control of the project without being limited by the original DevToys. I no longer want this to be a perfect copy of it but a completely different application.
